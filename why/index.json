  "title": "Why",
  "summary": "Because every modern logistics operation — from TMS platforms to carrier portals — runs on APIs.",
  "details": "When those APIs are exposed, even unintentionally, attackers can move money, shipments, and trust. Security scanners find patterns; we find behavior. That difference protects revenue, customers, and reputation.",
  "principles": [
    "APIs drive modern logistics operations.",
    "Exposure enables manipulation of money, shipments, and trust.",
    "Behavioral security over pattern-based detection."
